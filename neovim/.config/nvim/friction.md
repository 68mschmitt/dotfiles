# Friction in my workflow
- Close all buffers except active buffer

- Pressing Escape then o to create a new line and enter insert mode
 - I do this all the time

- Center page when using <C-d> and <C-u>

- When I paste directly from the register, the formatting is really weird

- Automatically spell correct a word instead of having to do `z=1<cr>`
